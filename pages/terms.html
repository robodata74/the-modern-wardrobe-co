    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Definitions and Scope</h2>
    <p>Welcome to The Modern Wardrobe Co. ("the Company", "we", "us", or "our"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of our website and services, including the display, purchase, and sale of bulk products listed on our platform. By using our site, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using our website, including retail and checkout pages, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, please do not use our services.</p>

    <h2>3. Product Listing and Purchase</h2>
    <p>All products displayed on our platform are for bulk trade only. Each product listing represents a single bulk item available for purchase. When you select a product, its unique identifier (ProductID) and relevant details (such as description, unit price, and quantity) are stored to enable a streamlined checkout process.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Prices, Payment, and Taxes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prices:</strong> All prices displayed are final and quoted in the specified currency.</li>
      <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> All taxes, duties, import fees, and related governmental charges are the sole responsibility of the purchaser.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Payment methods will be provided at checkout. Full payment is required before shipment unless otherwise agreed upon.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Shipping and Delivery</h2>
    <p>The Company acts only as an agent in transactions between the principal (the seller) and the buyer. Shipping and delivery arrangements are managed between the principal and the buyer. The Company is not liable for shipping delays, transit damage, or issues regarding delivery, and the risk of loss transfers to the buyer upon delivery as per the agreed shipping terms.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Sell for Us Platform Services</h2>
    <p>Our platform offers a "Sell for Us" service, enabling third parties to list and sell their products. In this role, we act solely as an intermediary. For facilitating these transactions, the Company earns a commission as per agreed service terms. We do not guarantee the accuracy of product listings or the behavior of third-party sellers; all sales are directly conducted between the seller (principal) and the buyer.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Order Cancellation and Modification</h2>
    <p>Once an order is confirmed and payment is made, the bulk item is removed from the available listings. Cancellation or modification requests after order confirmation are subject to the terms set by the principal and are outside our control.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Notifications and Communications</h2>
    <p>For every transaction, you will receive a notification via email and WhatsApp containing details such as ProductID, product description, quantity, unit price, and total price. By using our service, you consent to receive these communications. Additionally, notification of every transaction will be sent to the Companyâ€™s administrator.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Company provides its services on an "as is" basis without any express or implied warranties. We do not guarantee the quality, accuracy, or reliability of product listings. Under no circumstances will The Modern Wardrobe Co. be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages incurred as a result of using our services, including issues related to shipping, taxes, or disputes between the principal and the buyer.</p>
    
    <h2>10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Company operates, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms or the use of our services will be resolved in the competent courts of that jurisdiction.</p>
    
    <h2>11. Amendments</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to amend these Terms at any time. The most current version will be posted on our website, and your continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>
    
    <h2>12. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding these Terms, please contact us using the provided email or WhatsApp contact details on our website.</p>
    
    <h2>13. Additional Trade Terms</h2>
    <p>All taxes are the responsibility of the purchaser. Shipping responsibilities are shared between the principal (the seller) and the buyer, with our role being solely as an agent. In our "Sell for Us" service, the Company facilitates the sale of products by third parties and earns commission fees specified under separate agreements.</p>
